/**
 * Class Permission
 * Permissions in Discord are a way to limit and grant certain abilities to users. A set of base permissions
 * can be configured at the guild level for different roles, when these roles are attached to users they grant
 * or revoke specific privileges within the guild. Along with the global guild-level permissions,
 * Discord also supports role overwrites which can be set at the channel level allowing customization
 * of permissions on a per-role, per-channel basis.
 * Permissions in Discord are stored within a 53-bit integer and are calculated using bitwise operations.
 * Permissions for a user in a given channel can be calculated by ORing
 * together their guild-level role permission integers, and their channel-level role permission integers.
 * For more information about bitwise operations and flags, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field.
